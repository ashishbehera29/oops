Encapsulation-> 
* bindinng the relevent data and related method together in a class or entity is known as encapsulation.
* Encapsulation specifies binding the data together in class and protect the data with the help of access specifiesrs
*   There are 4 types of access specifiers ->
                    1-public access specifier
                     2-private access specifier
                     3-protected access specifier
                     4-default access specifier
* using encapsulation we can achive data hiding
* to get the value of a private varible we use getter method (getattributename)
* to set the value of a private varibale we use setter method (setattributename)

Inheritance->
*inheritance is a process of accquiring one class property and behaviour to another class
*inheritance also known as is-A relationship
*The class which takes the property and behaviour is called sub/child/derived class.
*The class which gives the property and behaviour is called parent/super/base class.
*we can achive inheritance whith the help of 'EXTENDS' keyword.

       Advantages->
       *to avoid code duplication
       *to achive code reusability
       *to achive generalisation 
*There are 5 types of inheritance 
     1-single level inheritance->a subclass inherit the property and behviour from onr super class.
     2-multi level inheritance->a subclass inherit the property from one super class and thst super class act as a sub class and inherit property from another 
                                 super class  (middle layer is called immidiate layer)
     3-multiple inheritance->one sub class inherit the property from more than one super class(this is not possible in java because of dimond problem)
     4-hierachical inheritance->one or more sub class inherit the property from one super class
     5-hybrid inheritance->combination of any two or more inheritance.

Polymerphism->
*An object showing diffrent behaviour at diffrent stages of its lyfecycle
*There are two types of polymerphism
         1-completime polymephism(overloading)
         2-runtime polymerphism(is-a relationshi, method overriding,typecasting)
